<!-- and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). -->

## 0.1.8 - 05-28-2019

### Changed

-   Addresses #5:
    -   Removed background color from `TEPanelWrapper`
    -   Removed the `wrapperHeight` props as it was only used to extend the background color.
    -   Added the background color from `TEPanelWrapper` to `TEBodyContainer`.
    -   Updated `TEBodyContainer` `min-height` styling from `100%` -> `100vh`

### Added

-   `useTEPopups` - This provides easy functions to call instead of remembering the dispatch keys in `TEPopupContext`. Addresses #7.
-   Added a `Header` component prop to `TESideNavbar`. This allows for a custom header component instead of simply passing a prop to the logo img src. Addresses #8
-   Updated `TEPrivateRoute`'s `isAuthenticated` and `hasPermissions` props to be functions that receive all the props from React Router. This allows more dynamic handling of authentication. Addresses #13
-   Added additional options to the `size` prop of `TEPanel` ("three-quarter", "quarter", "condensed") Addresses #14

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed redirect issues fixed with `TEPrivateRoute`

## 0.1.5 - 04-14-2019

### Changed
