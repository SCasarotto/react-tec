## 0.3.2 - 2-21-2020

## Bug Fix

-   Fixed `id` bug with `TEDatetimeInput`. It was being appled to both inputs when using `withPortalButton`.

## 0.3.0 - 2-20-2020

## Breaking

-   Be aware that `react-phone-number-input` from `^2.4.1` to `^3.0.18` as a result you should be sure to update how you overwrite the styling on this component as well as [other concerns](https://github.com/catamphetamine/react-phone-number-input/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#300--01012020).
-   Be aware that `styled-components` from `^4.4.0` to `^5.0.1`. This update requires you update to v5 however the [changes](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v500---2020-01-13) had no noticeable impact on this library.

## Added

-   `TEDatetimeInput` now has a new prop. `withPortalButton`. The goal of this prop was to allow for both typing and the modal selection. I have found that the modal view works well on touch or smaller devices. This is something I may attempt to suggest into the core lib but for now it is just an abstraction. (#49)

## Bug Fix

-   A full review of component styling was reviewed when `disabled`. (#46)
-   Quick review of component styling in Safari. Made more consistent.

## 0.2.7 - 12-3-2019

## Bug Fix

-   `TEImageRow` EditorPopup wasn't closing when cancel was pressed. This resolves that.

## 0.2.6 - 12-3-2019

## Changes

-   Updated `react-phone-number-input` from `2.4.1` to `2.5.0`

## 0.2.5 - 12-3-2019

## Bug Fixes

-   Fixed styling of `TEPhoneNumberInput`. Addresses (#43)

## 0.2.4 - 11-27-2019

## Added

-   `TEPhoneNumberInput` and `TEPhoneNumberRow` have been added based on [react-phone-number-input](https://github.com/catamphetamine/react-phone-number-input).
-   `TEMenuButton` has been added primarily relying on [react-popper](https://github.com/popperjs/react-popper)

## Changes

-   Many components now have the ability to pass down refs in addition the typing for them have been changed away from `any` to something meaningful.

## 0.2.3 - 11-24-2019

## Added

-   `TESelect` and `TESelectRow`. These two components are based on [react-select](https://github.com/jedwatson/react-select). The plan is to eventually replace `TESearchSelect` and `TESearchSelectRow` with these as these libraries are more well maintained and have a more consistent API.

## Changes

-   Added mobile responsiveness to the docs site
-   Updated `react-datepicker` from `v2.10.0` to `2.10.1`

## Bug Fixes

-   Fixed the broken links in the documentation

## 0.2.2 - 11-18-2019

## Added

-   Now export some helper functions
-   Added `styled-components`, `react-router`, and `react-router-dom` to devDependencies to allow for test writing but had to also use `rollup-plugin-peer-deps-external` to ensure they were not bundled during build.
-   Updated doc site to not `link` but instead use the deployed version in order not to have the devDependencies included.

## 0.2.1 - 11-16-2019

## Changes

-   Small styling changes to TEFileManagerRow

## 0.2.0 - 11-16-2019

This update is a complete rewrite of react-tec. Moving from [Create React Library](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library#readme) to [tsdx](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx). This means the lirbary is written in typescript and thus keeps the type definitions up to date. In this transition some things were refined and others bugs were fixed (conflicts with base html props). This shift will result in a more maintainable library using up to date libraries. Please see the mentionable changes below.

### BREAKING CHANGES

-   `TERow` prop `size` has been changed to `rowSize`. Thus all "Row"s (Ex. `TEInputRow`) and "Groups" (Ex. `TECheckboxGroup`) now use `rowSize` instead of `row`.
-   "Groups" (Ex. `TECheckboxGroup`) prop `rowSize` that previously determined how many checkboxs would be in a row is now `inputRowSize`.
-   `TEInputRow` no longer can accept `type='textarea'`. There is now a `TETextareaRow`.
-   `TEPrivateRoute` no longer accepts `isAuthenticated`, `hasPermissions`, `authPath`, `accessDeniedPath` instead it accepts an array `authChecks` containing `check` function and `path` string. This allow for full generalization of as many layers of checks required.
-   `TEHelmet` is no longer apart of this package. This was entirely a passthrough component and was unnessisary. Use react-helmet from now on.
-   Replaced `TEScrollToTop` with a utility hook `useScrollTop`.
-   `TEImageRow` `imgSrc` prop is not `imgSrcArray` just like `TEFileManagerRow`
-   All forms (`TEForm`, `TEPopupForm`, `TEMultiStepForm`, etc) all now provide the submit event to the `onSubmit` function. This mean you will now need to add `event.preventDefault()` to your `onSubmit` function.
